# Finance AI Agent Project
## Project Overview
This project s a great example of an LLM-powered agentic system in a specific domain (finance).
A multi-agent AI system integrating open-source and OpenAI LLMs to analyze financial data, aggregate news, and deliver actionable insights using APIs like YFinance and DuckDuckGo.

A Python-based project that compares AI agents from different providers (Groq and OpenAI) for financial analysis tasks. The project includes two main scripts: one for single-agent analysis and another for multi-agent team collaboration.

### Key Features:
- Multi-agent setup ‚Äì likely distinct components or personas (e.g., a financial analyst agent, news summarizer agent, etc.)
- Tool use ‚Äì fetches external data (e.g., stock prices, news) using APIs
- Reasoning & decision-making ‚Äì probably uses LLMs to draw conclusions or generate insights from combined data
- Natural language interface ‚Äì possibly allows querying or explanation in human-readable form

### Is it an AI Agent?

Yes. Each part (e.g., fetching stock data, summarizing news, generating insights) acts like an AI agent‚Äîa function with a clear task.

### Is it Agentic AI?

Partially, yes. Here's why:

| Agentic Trait        | Present in Repo? | Notes |
|----------------------|------------------|-------|
| Tool integration     | ‚úÖ Yes           | Uses YFinance, news APIs |
| Reasoning           | ‚úÖ Yes           | LLM used to interpret and combine signals |
| Planning            | üü° Partial       | Might be fixed logic; true planning would require dynamic task chaining |
| Memory/State        | ‚ùå No            | Likely stateless (no long-term memory of past runs) |
| Delegation/Subagents| üü° Partial       | If multi-agent is hard-coded, not dynamic delegation |
| Autonomy            | ‚ùå No            | Needs user to trigger execution (not persistent or self-initiating) |

Finance AI Agent is a strong example of a modular, task-focused AI agent system with some agentic traits. It doesn‚Äôt yet reach full Agentic AI status (e.g., self-planning, persistent memory, dynamic agent coordination), but it‚Äôs a practical and well-scoped implementation of agent-based thinking applied to real-world data.


## Theory
In this theory section, we‚Äôll explore the common patterns for agentic systems. We'll start with our foundational building block‚Äîthe augmented LLM‚Äîand progressively increase complexity, from simple compositional workflows to  autonomous agents.

### Building block: The augmented LLM

The basic building block of agentic systems is an LLM enhanced with augmentations such as retrieval, tools, and memory. Our current models can actively use the augmentation of using the tools and determining what information to retain. Further, these tools act as a independent agents and can work in parallel to each other to retrieve information and provide a response.

In this project, the usage of single agent and multi-agent team is compared. In the single agent case, the agent is using the Yahoo Finance tools to retrieve information from the Yahoo Finance API provided as a inbuild function from the PHI data and provide a response according to the user query about the stock provided by the user. In the multi-agent case, the one agent is using the tools to retrieve information from the Yahoo Finance API and another agent is using the tools to latest web information from the duckduckgo API and provide a response of the latest web information about the stock provided by the user.


![Multi Agent Architecture](src/utils/images/agent_call_image.png)

As together, we make this as LLM enhanced agentic method to retrieve information from the Yahoo Finance API and provide a response of the latest web information about the stock provided by the user. But this is not the end of the story. As said in this block post [Anthropic - Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents)*, we can make this as a autonomous agent to retrieve information from the Yahoo Finance API and provide a response of the latest web information about the stock provided by the user and connecting to the appropriate stock broker to place the order when the certain conditions are met. This make a complete autonomous agent for the stock information and trading but there should be a human in the loop to watch this process as it's still in the developemnt phase.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- API keys for:
  - Groq
  - OpenAI
- Make sure you have the required dependencies installed by running `make install`

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
